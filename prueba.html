      <p>Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end
      of the western spiral arm of the Galaxy lies a small unregarded
      yellow sun. Orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety-two million
      miles is an utterly insignificant little blue green planet whose
      ape-descended life forms are so amazingly primitive that they still
      think digital watches are a pretty neat idea.</p>
